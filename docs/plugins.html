        <p>Making NDIToolbox do more</p>
    </div>
    <p>NDIToolbox supports the execution of <em>plugins</em>, additional bits of code that can be loaded to extend its
        functionality. Here we'll discuss what a plugin is and how to use one.</p>

    <h2>What Is A Plugin?</h2>

    <p>In a nutshell, a plugin is an extra bit of software that's designed to work with NDIToolbox and extend its
        functionality. For the most part, plugins in NDIToolbox tend to be small programs - they usually do one thing
        and one thing only, and they usually do not have a separate user interface. The idea is to have a simple program
        that receives NDE data and configuration info; performs some sort of function on the data; then returns the
        results. NDIToolbox worries about the details of how to read data and present it to the user.</p>

    <p>If you're an end user, you can add plugins to your NDIToolbox installation to make the program work for your
        needs. If you're more of a developer, you can <a href="plugins_developers.html">create your own plugins</a> and
        share them with others.</p>

    <a name="user"><h2>Plugins For The End User</h2></a>

    <a name="user_install"><h3>Installation</h3></a>

    <p>All NDIToolbox plugins must be installed under your plugins folder, which is a subfolder of your NDIToolbox local
        files folder. Remember from the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start</a> guide that this folder will be under
        your <code>$HOME</code> folder (e.g. <code>c:\users\chris</code> in Windows 7 or <code>/home/chris</code> under
        Linux).</p>

    <p class="centeredImage"><a href="images/folder_layout.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/folder_layout.png"
                                                                                    width="377" height="219"/></a></p>

    <p>Although you can copy a plugin directly to this folder manually, we recommend using NDIToolbox to install your
        plugins since NDIToolbox will ensure that the plugin is properly structured. From any Plot window, select
        <strong>Plugins</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. If you already have a copy of the plugin as a ZIP
        archive, choose <strong>Install Plugin...</strong>
        and select the ZIP to install. The <strong>Install Plugin</strong> window will pop up, from which you can get
        more
        information
        about the plugin by pressing the <strong>About Plugin...</strong> button.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage"><a href="images/install_plugin.png" rel="lightbox" title="Install Plugin Window"><img
            src="images/install_plugin.png" width="272" height="349"/> </a></p>

    <p>If the ZIP archive has been password-protected, make sure the <strong>Protected</strong> check box is checked and
        provide the
        password you were given by the plugin's author. When ready to install, click <strong>OK</strong> to proceed.
        NDIToolbox will
        unpack the ZIP archive and install the plugin in your local files folder. If the plugin doesn't seem to be a
        proper NDIToolbox plugin, NDIToolbox will abort installation and notify you of the situation.</p>

    <p>NDIToolbox can also automatically download and install plugins, for example if you're installing a commercial
        plugin. The installation procedure is nearly the same as for installing a plugin you've already got locally, but
        from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu select <strong>Download Plugin...</strong> and fill in the <strong>Install
            Plugin</strong> window that appears. Among other
        things, you'll need the full URL to the plugin; if the server hosting the plugin download requires a login you
        can specify a username and password in this window as well. As is the case with installing a local plugin, if
        the plugin archive is password-protected you should enter the password in this window.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage"><a href="images/download_plugin.png" rel="lightbox" title="Download Plugin Window"><img
            src="images/download_plugin.png" width="213" height="68"/></a></p>

    <a name="user_running"><h3>Running A Plugin</h3></a>

    <p>Once a plugin has been successfully installed, you can run it simply by selecting it from the list of plugins.
        Under the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, select the <strong>Plugins</strong> submenu, then click the name of the
        plugin you wish to execute.</p>

    <p>If a plugin requires extra information from you before executing, it will open a new window asking for the input.
        For example, NDIToolbox includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter">median filter</a> plugin
        that when run asks you to specify the rank (also known as the window length or kernel size) of the filter as
        shown
        below. In
        this example, the user is instructing the median filter plugin to run a filter of rank 3 on the data.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage"><a href="images/medfilter_config.png" rel="lightbox"
                                title="Median Filter Configuration Window"><img src="images/medfilter_config.png"
                                                                                width="205" height="287"/></a></p>

    <p>When a plugin is run, NDIToolbox passes it a copy of the current data set displayed in the plot window. The
        plugin performs its function on this data and returns it to NDIToolbox, which then updates the plot window with
        the results. Going back to the median filter plugin, here's an example of the results of applying this plugin
        against an ultrasonic C-scan. The image on the left is the original C-scan image plot; on the right is the
        resulting C-scan after a median filter of rank 5 has been applied.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage"><a href="images/cscan_prefiltration.png" rel="lightbox[prepostfilter]"
                                title="Original C-scan"><img src="images/cscan_prefiltration.png" width="207"
                                                             height="211"/></a><a href="images/cscan_postfiltration.png"
                                                                                  rel="lightbox[prepostfilter]"
                                                                                  title="C-scan (Median Filter Rank 5)"><img
            src="images/cscan_postfiltration.png" width="206" height="210"/></a></p>

    <p>Since NDIToolbox keeps a copy of the original data, you can always reverse any changes a plugin makes to your
        data by selecting <strong>Revert To Original</strong> from the plot window's <strong>Operations</strong> menu.
        The
        original data will be reloaded
        and the changes made by the plugin will be discarded.</p>

    <h4>Tips For Running Plugins</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Work with the smallest data set you can.</b> Since a plugin's time to complete is tied to the size of the
            data you run it against (the bigger the data the longer the plugin takes to run), you can speed things along
            by running plugins against data subsets where possible.
        </li>
        <li><b>Plugins and data dimensions.</b> Not all plugins are capable of handling data with 3 or more dimensions.
            If you get strange results or errors when running a plugin against 3D data, it may be that the plugin wasn't
            written to deal with this type of data.
        </li>
        <li><b>Plugins and the "MegaPlot."</b> Unless written specifically for this purpose, most plugins will not
            perform as expected when run against data in the MegaPlot. To work with this data presentation, the plugin
            would need to know not only how to deal with 3D data, but also how to retrieve data from the A, C, and B
            scans.
        </li>
    </ul>
